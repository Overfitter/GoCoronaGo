**Search-engine-on-steroids.** Korono is a question-answering platform conceived to facilitate the research of information regarding COVID-19. You can think of Korono as a search-engine-on-steroids.

**Working principle.** Korono engine is composed of two phases: the search engine phase and the question-answering phase. In the first place, given a query `q`, the search engine returns all relevant papers from that query. Later on, the answer is extracted from each paper and displayed.
